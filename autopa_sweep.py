#
# AUTOPA_SWEEP drives an asymmetric slow/fast square-wave extrusion in air at a
# grid of pressure-advance K values and measures how well the load-cell force
# tracks the commanded flow. The estimator (ported numpy-only in
# sweep_analysis.py, output-identical to the upstream scipy original) is the
# bd step-response cost minimum -> K_opt. (The phase-lag and integral-area
# estimators were tried during R&D and dropped -- noise on this load cell; the
# port keeps only the bd path.)
#
# AXIS WOBBLE (required for any signal): Klipper only applies pressure advance
# to a move that has X or Y motion -- kinematics/extruder.py sets
# `can_pressure_advance = axis_r > 0 and (axes_d[0] or axes_d[1])`. A pure-E
# sweep therefore leaves PA *inert*: every K produces identical motion and the
# estimators see nothing but noise/priming drift. So each leg couples a tiny
# move on one axis (WOBBLEAXIS, default Y; X also works -- Z does NOT, it is not
# gated in) by WOBBLE mm. The slow legs sit at base+WOBBLE, the fast legs return
# to base, so every slow<->fast transition is an axis reversal that flips the PA
# gate on. The wobble is quasi-static (e.g. 0.05mm over a 0.25-1.0s leg =
# 0.05-0.2 mm/s) -- it exists only to satisfy the firmware gate, not to move the
# toolhead meaningfully, and on a bed-slinger a Y wobble doesn't touch the head
# at all. Exact per-cycle transition times come from print-time lookahead
# callbacks -- no marker pulse / clock-recovery needed.
#
# Because the leg is now a composite XY+E move, Klipper enforces
# `max_extrude_cross_section` on it (a large E over a tiny XY move = a high
# extrude ratio). We pre-check and, if the configured wobble would trip it, tell
# the operator the exact value to set. The leg's E-velocity step sharpness (what
# PA actually acts on) is governed by the toolhead accel here, not
# max_extrude_only_accel, so ACCEL is applied via SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT and
# restored afterwards.
#
# FUTURE (drop the wobble): the cleaner fix is upstream -- a Klipper gcode/config
# knob to force `can_pressure_advance` on for extrude-only moves (e.g. a
# SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE flag or a per-move override). With that, an in-air PA
# measurement needs no axis motion at all and WOBBLE can go to 0. Intend to PR
# this to Klipper; until it lands (and on older Klipper), the wobble is required.
# Setting WOBBLE=0 already selects the pure-E path for that future / for testing,
# but on current Klipper it measures nothing.
